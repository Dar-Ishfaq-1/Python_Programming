## 📂 Project Organization

To maintain high standards of documentation and clarity, each assignment folder follows a consistent structure:

* **Script Naming**: All files follow the convention `Assignment_[X]_Task_[Y]_Ishfaq_Dar.py`.
* **Independent Documentation**: Each folder contains a dedicated `README.md` that explains the task objectives, logic applied, and execution instructions.
* **Version Control**: Each assignment is managed as an independent module to facilitate individual submission and review.
